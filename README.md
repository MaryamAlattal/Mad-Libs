# Mad-Libs

Mad Libs is a word game where players fill in blanks in a story with different types of words (like nouns,
verbs, and adjectives) to create a funny or silly result.

The fun comes from not knowing the story beforehand and seeing the amusing combinations when the words are revealed.
It's a lighthearted and creative game often played for laughs.
